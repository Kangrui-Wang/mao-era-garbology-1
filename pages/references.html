            <p>To fully comprehend the contents of Mao Era Garbology and to pursue further studies of Modern Chinese History (post-1949), knowers must be familiar with the broader political and ideological context(s) of revolutionary China. Simply interpreting the developments and policies of China, particularly those that relate to Mao, with generic approaches of history and political science often fails to derive satisfactory conclusions and produces insights that are rather "non-insightful."</p>
            <p>This necessitates that researchers be familiar with the broader ideas of "Socialism" (and its more advanced form "Communism"), Marxism-Leninism, and the Mao Tse-tung Thought as the lens through which modern Chinese history will be interpreted. For instance, in the evaluation of the conflicts between Mao and Liu (Liu Shaoqi) in the 1960s, it is vital to understand the underlying debate and disagreements between Mao and Liu regarding the issue of "how can socialism be built in a country?" instead of attributing the event as a "struggle for power" in the upper echelons of the Chinese political edifice.</p>
            <p>Granted, scholarly works of academia should not be neglected, insofar as they furnish rigorous evaluations and critical analyses of historical phenomena. By interrogating the past through methodological and theoretical frameworks, such works yield indispensable insights — not merely in reconstructing events, but in illuminating the epistemic structures through which these issues might be productively examined. It is encouraged that researchers seek a wide array of sources to find nuances and subtleties in history, as both are interwoven into the fundamental building blocks of history as a discipline.</p>
            <p>Thus, the sources below are both what Mao Era Garbology references in the production of its knowledge and what Mao Era Garbology recommends that researchers be familiar with to invigorate their understanding of Modern Chinese History, particularly the Mao and "Mao-vicinity" Era(s).</p>
